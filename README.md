<h2> Food Blog </h2>

The last project of the year, the goal was to implement all the things I learned this year. 

Requirements for the project was to build a blog site, using Wordress REST API, implement image carousel, image modal, contact form using javascript, build and display post fetched with API.

 It was free to choose sites theme, so I build a food blog concentrated around asian cuisine. 

<h3><strong>The websites architecture:</strong></h3>

<ul>
    <li>Home page</li>
    <li>Recipes page</li>
    <li>Single recipe</li>
    <li>About Us page</li>
    <li>Contact page</li>
</ul>
